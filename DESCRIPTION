Description: A novel face space model--parametric face drawings (or PFDs)--that is is used to generate schematic, 
    though realistic, parameterized line drawings of faces based on the statistical distribution of human facial features.
    The model is based on a demographically diverse sample of 400 faces (200 female, 200 male; 100 East Asian/Pacific Islander, 
    100 Latinx/Hispanic, 100 black/African-American, and 100 white/Caucasian) compiled from several face databases.
